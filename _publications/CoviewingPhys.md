excerpt: 'This study explores the relationship between parental coviewing and children&apos;s psychophysiological responses to television exposure within a framework of social facilitation. A total of 88 children aged 6-13 years and one of each of their parents participated in a 2 (presence or absence of the parent) x 2 (exciting or non-exciting TV content) between-subjects experiment. Results indicated that the presence of a coviewing parent was associated with an increase in children&apos;s arousal (higher skin conductance levels) and cognitive resource allocation (lower heart rate), especially for younger children who came from homes where parental coviewing was a relatively frequent activity. These findings suggest that the mere presence of a coviewing parent is sufficient to alter children&apos;s processing of television messages.'
