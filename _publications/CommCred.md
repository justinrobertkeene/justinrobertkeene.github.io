title: "Sports commentators and source credibility: Do those who can’t play…commentate? "

excerpt: 'Although research has examined how commentators shape perceptions of mediated sports, the area of commentator credibility remains unexplored. Using an experimental design, this study examined the effects of commentators’ previous athletic experience on the perceived credibility of sports broadcasters and viewers’ evaluations of game play. Results showed that experience impacts viewers’ perceptions of credibility such that commentators without experience were viewed as least credible and their games were rated as less exciting and enjoyable.'
