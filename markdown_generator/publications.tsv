In this manuscript, we present an overview of research from within communication and cognate disciplines that has leveraged insights from fMRI research to ""push the envelope,"" demonstrating a synergy between methodological and theoretical progress. In addition, we provide a review of fMRI technology, methodology, and theoretical considerations, focusing on recent developments in the cognitive and brain sciences that are of special relevance to communication scholars. Finally, we provide a series of practical recommendations and resources for communication scholars interested in conducting fMRI studies."	"Weber, R.,  Fisher, J.T. , Hopp, F., & Lonergan, C. (2018).
