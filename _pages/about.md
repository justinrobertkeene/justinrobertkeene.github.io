I am a researcher in the [Media Neuroscience Lab](http://www.medianeuroscience.org/) and a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am also a member of the National Science Foundation [IGERT](https://networkscience.igert.ucsb.edu/) for Network Science and Big Data. 

I conduct research in two main areas:

First, I investigate the role of attention in multimedia processing and media multitasking. My current work in this area uses functional neuroimaging and behavioral measures to explore how cognitive and perceptual load in digital environments can modulate attention networks in the brain, and how these modulatory effects can be harnessed to develop novel treatments for cognitive processing disorders such as ADHD. This project has resulted in a recently published [systematic review](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23808985.2018.1534552) and [theoretical update](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23808985.2018.1534551) of the Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP).

I also study theoretical and methodological issues surrounding the extraction and analysis of moral content in news, movies, and other media texts. This project involves the use and development of computational social science tools including natural language processing, machine learning, and nonrelational database management. Current work in this area is aimed at building an updated dictionary for the processing of moral information in large textual corpora, exploring novel measures of framing based on network analytic approaches, and building and maintaining a large open-source database for the analysis of news data from around the world.
