I am a researcher in the [Media Neuroscience Lab](http://www.medianeuroscience.org/) and a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am also a member of the National Science Foundation [IGERT](https://networkscience.igert.ucsb.edu/) for Network Science and Big Data. 

I conduct research in two main areas. First, I am interested in the role of attention in multimedia processing and media multitasking. My current work in this area investigates how certain digital environments can modulate attentional networks in the brain, and how these modulatory effects can be harnessed to develop novel treatments for cognitive processing disorders like ADHD.

I am also interested in extraction and analysis of moral content in news, movies, and other media texts. Current work in this area is aimed at developing an updated dictionary for the processing of moral information in large textual corpora, developing novel measures of framing based on network analytic approaches, and building and maintaining a large open-sourced database for the analysis of news data from around the world.
