I am a researcher in the [Media Neuroscience Lab](http://www.medianeuroscience.org/) and a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am also a member of the National Science Foundation [IGERT](https://networkscience.igert.ucsb.edu/) for Network Science and Big Data. 

I conduct research in two main areas. First, I am interested in the ways in which individuals with cognitive processing disabilities such as ADHD engage with and process mediated messages. Does the ADHD brainâ€™s difficulty in determining motivationally relevant and task-relevant stimuli affect the way the brain processes these stimuli? How does this affect the encoding, storage, and retrieval process for these individuals? How can we better understand those differences in ways that can help to guide the development and adoption of video-heavy online courses? I am also interested in studying the processing of highly morally, politically, and ideologically loaded messages. Are these messages processed in different ways than simply highly positive or highly negative messages? What are the implications of these differences, if present, in understanding polarization in an increasingly narrowcasted, siloed media environment?
